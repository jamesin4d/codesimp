# codesimp
*not safe for use around crotchety people offended by the use of comedic profanity

a plugin for godot that adds typing effects, leveling "rewards" and a code simp
a modified version of fun-coding plugin by night_glider to give new meaning to the animated "pet" idea
I rebranded it as a floating magic head that wants to gaze upon your sweet programmings skills, or the CodeSimp.
# right-clicking codeSimp locks him in place
# middle-clicking releases him
# typing is what he wants...
